## ðŸ”’ Synchronization

### What is Synchronization in Java?

Let's think about it for a moment. Multiple threads updating the **same** thing sounds harmless... until it isn't. If two threads read the same value, increment it, and write back, one increment can **disappear**. That's the essence of a **race condition**.

**Does Java fix this automatically?**\
**No.** You, the programmer, must protect the **critical section** where shared state is read-modify-written.

### Lost updates without synchronization

```java
package io.github.smdaziz.thread.synchronization;

public class CounterNoSyncThread {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        // Thread-unsafe counter
        // The goal is to increment the counter 3000000 times (1000000 times by each thread)
        MillionCounter millionCounter = new MillionCounter();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(millionCounter);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(millionCounter);
        Thread t3 = new Thread(millionCounter);

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        t3.start();

        t1.join();
        t2.join();
        t3.join();

        System.out.println("Final count (no synchronization): " + millionCounter.getCount());
    }
}

class MillionCounter implements Runnable {
    private int count = 0;

    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

We launch three threads, all hammering on a shared counter. Intuitively, you expect the final number to be exactly the total increments.

**What actually happens:** the result is often **less** or sometimes **more** than expected.\
Why? `count++` isn't atomic --- it's read â†’ add â†’ write. Two threads can interleave and overwrite each other's updates.

**What it shows:**
-   **Race condition** in the wild.
-   "But it worked on my machine once!" --- yep, timing-dependent bugs are sneaky.

**Takeaways:**
-   A plain `int` (or `long`) plus `++` is not safe across threads.
-   `volatile` alone won't help here --- it gives **visibility**, not **atomicity**.
-   You need mutual exclusion (e.g., `synchronized`) or atomic utilities (e.g., `AtomicInteger`).

### Coarse-grained locking with a synchronized block

```java
package io.github.smdaziz.thread.synchronization;

public class CounterSyncBlockThread {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        // Thread-unsafe counter
        // The goal is to increment the counter 3000000 times (1000000 times by each thread)
        MillionCounterV3 millionCounter = new MillionCounterV3();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(millionCounter);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(millionCounter);
        Thread t3 = new Thread(millionCounter);

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        t3.start();

        t1.join();
        t2.join();
        t3.join();

        System.out.println("Final count (no synchronization): " + millionCounter.getCount());
    }
}

class MillionCounterV3 implements Runnable {
    private int count = 0;

    public void run() {
        synchronized(this) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

We add a `synchronized (this)` around the whole increment loop.

**What it shows:**
-   The final count becomes **correct** and **deterministic**.
-   All three threads now **serialize** at that block --- only one runs the loop at a time. Correctness â†‘, parallelism â†“.

**Takeaways:**
-   Coarse-grained locking is the easiest fix but can **eliminate concurrency**.
-   Keep the **critical section minimal**: protect just the shared mutation, not unrelated work.
-   (Minor note for your print line: the label says "no synchronization" --- you'll want to update that message to reflect that this version is synchronized.)

### Coarse-grained locking via a synchronized method

```java
package io.github.smdaziz.thread.synchronization;

public class CounterSyncMethodThread {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        // Thread-unsafe counter
        // The goal is to increment the counter 3000000 times (1000000 times by each thread)
        MillionCounterV2 millionCounter = new MillionCounterV2();

        Thread t1 = new Thread(millionCounter);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(millionCounter);
        Thread t3 = new Thread(millionCounter);

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        t3.start();

        t1.join();
        t2.join();
        t3.join();

        System.out.println("Final count (no synchronization): " + millionCounter.getCount());
    }
}

class MillionCounterV2 implements Runnable {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

Same idea as Example 2, different syntax: mark the `run()` method `synchronized`.

**What it shows:**
-   Equivalent to Example 2: the entire method is a critical section.
-   Again: **correct** result, but threads run the loop one after another.

**Takeaways:**
-   Method-level `synchronized` is a clean, readable way to guard critical sections.
-   Still coarse-grained. If performance matters, **shrink** the lock's scope.
-   If you only need atomic increments, consider `AtomicInteger.incrementAndGet()` as a lock-free alternative.

### Producer/Consumer with a single-slot buffer

```java
package io.github.smdaziz.thread.synchronization;

public class SingleSlotBufferThread {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SingleSlotBuffer buffer = new SingleSlotBuffer();
        Thread producerThread = new Thread(new IntProducer(buffer), "ProducerThread");
        Thread consumerThread = new Thread(new IntConsumer(buffer), "ConsumerThread");

        producerThread.start();
        consumerThread.start();
    }

}

class IntProducer implements Runnable {

    private SingleSlotBuffer buffer;

    public IntProducer(SingleSlotBuffer buffer) {
        this.buffer = buffer;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
                System.out.println("Producing " + i);
                buffer.put(i);
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate time taken to produce
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}

class IntConsumer implements Runnable {

    private SingleSlotBuffer buffer;

    public IntConsumer(SingleSlotBuffer buffer) {
        this.buffer = buffer;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
                int value = buffer.get();
                System.out.println("Consuming " + value);
                Thread.sleep(1500); // Simulate time taken to consume
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}

class SingleSlotBuffer {

    private Integer slot = null;

    public void put(int value) throws InterruptedException {
        if(slot != null) {
            this.wait();
        }
        slot = value;
        this.notify();
    }

    public int get() throws InterruptedException {
        if(slot == null) {
            this.wait();
        }
        int value = slot;
        slot = null;
        this.notify();
        return value;
    }

}
```

As much as it looks it should work, it actually doesn't! It crashes at runtime with an `IllegalMonitorStateException`.

#### What happens?

-   You'll likely see:
    -   `Producing 1`
    -   Then an exception like:
        `Exception in thread "ProducerThread" java.lang.IllegalMonitorStateException
            at java.lang.Object.notify(Native Method)
            at SingleSlotBuffer.put(...)`
    -   (If the consumer runs first, you'll instead get the same exception from `wait()` in `get()`.)

#### Why it happens
-   `wait()` and `notify()/notifyAll()` **must be called while holding the same monitor** you're waiting/notifying on.
-   In our `SingleSlotBuffer`, both `put()` and `get()` **are not synchronized**, so the calling thread does **not** own `this`'s monitor when it calls `wait()`/`notify()`.
-   The JVM throws `IllegalMonitorStateException` to enforce this rule.

```java
package io.github.smdaziz.thread.synchronization;

public class SingleSlotBufferThread {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SingleSlotBuffer buffer = new SingleSlotBuffer();
        Thread producerThread = new Thread(new IntProducer(buffer), "ProducerThread");
        Thread consumerThread = new Thread(new IntConsumer(buffer), "ConsumerThread");

        producerThread.start();
        consumerThread.start();
    }

}

class IntProducer implements Runnable {

    private SingleSlotBuffer buffer;

    public IntProducer(SingleSlotBuffer buffer) {
        this.buffer = buffer;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
                System.out.println("Producing " + i);
                buffer.put(i);
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate time taken to produce
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}

class IntConsumer implements Runnable {

    private SingleSlotBuffer buffer;

    public IntConsumer(SingleSlotBuffer buffer) {
        this.buffer = buffer;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        try {
            for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
                int value = buffer.get();
                System.out.println("Consuming " + value);
                Thread.sleep(1500); // Simulate time taken to consume
            }
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
        }
    }
}

class SingleSlotBuffer {

    private Integer slot = null;

    public synchronized void put(int value) throws InterruptedException {
        if(slot != null) {
            this.wait();
        }
        slot = value;
        this.notify();
    }

    public synchronized int get() throws InterruptedException {
        if(slot == null) {
            this.wait();
        }
        int value = slot;
        slot = null;
        this.notify();
        return value;
    }

}
```

We wire up one producer (puts integers 1..10) and one consumer (takes them). The buffer holds **one** item at a time.

**What it shows:**
-   **`wait()` / `notify()`** basics:
    -   When the buffer is **full**, producer calls `wait()` and releases the lock.
    -   When the buffer is **empty**, consumer calls `wait()` and releases the lock.
    -   After a successful `put` or `get`, the thread calls `notify()` to wake the other.
-   **Must be inside `synchronized`**: both `wait()` and `notify()` are monitor methods; calling them outside a synchronized context is illegal.

- **Important correctness notes (edge cases you can demo next):**
-   Use **`while`** instead of **`if`** around the wait conditions. Spurious wakeups are allowed; recheck the condition after waking up.
    -   Replace: `if (slot == null) wait();` with `while (slot == null) wait();` (and similarly for "buffer full").
-   `notify()` vs `notifyAll()`: with exactly **one** producer and **one** consumer, `notify()` is fine.
    -   If you ever extend to **multiple** producers/consumers, prefer `notifyAll()` to avoid **missed signals** / wrong thread waking.
-   The different `sleep()` timings (producer 1s, consumer 1.5s) let you **see blocking** in action: sometimes the producer must wait for the consumer to make room, sometimes the consumer waits for the producer to fill the slot.

**Takeaways:**
-   `wait()` **releases** the lock and suspends the thread; `notify()` wakes a waiter, but the woken thread still needs to **reacquire** the lock.
-   Always guard wait conditions with a **loop**.
-   For more complex flows, higher-level tools (`BlockingQueue`, `Condition`, `Semaphore`) are simpler and less error-prone.

### Producer/Consumer with a bounded buffer

```java
package io.github.smdaziz.thread.synchronization;

import java.util.Random;

public class BoundedBufferThread {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Main thread started");
        BoundedBuffer buffer = new BoundedBuffer(3);
        Thread producerThread = new Thread(new BoundedBufferProducer(buffer));
        Thread consumerThread = new Thread(new BoundedBufferConsumer(buffer));
        producerThread.start();
        consumerThread.start();
        try {
            producerThread.join();
            consumerThread.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println("Main thread finished");
    }

}

class BoundedBufferProducer implements Runnable {

    private BoundedBuffer buffer;

    public BoundedBufferProducer(BoundedBuffer buffer) {
        this.buffer = buffer;
    }

    public void run() {
        Random random = new Random();
        for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            try {
                buffer.put(i);
                System.out.println("Produced: " + i);
                Thread.sleep(random.nextInt(10) * 250);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }

}

class BoundedBufferConsumer implements Runnable {

    private BoundedBuffer buffer;

    public BoundedBufferConsumer(BoundedBuffer buffer) {
        this.buffer = buffer;
    }

    public void run() {
        Random random = new Random();
        for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            try {
                int value = buffer.get();
                System.out.println("Consumed: " + value);
                Thread.sleep(random.nextInt(10) * 200);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }

}

class BoundedBuffer {

    private Integer[] buffer;
    private int putIndex = 0;
    private int takeIndex = 0;

    public BoundedBuffer(int size) {
        buffer = new Integer[size];
    }

    private boolean isFull() {
        for(Integer i : buffer) {
            if(i == null) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    private boolean isEmpty() {
        for(Integer i : buffer) {
            if(i != null) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    public synchronized void put(int value) throws InterruptedException {
        while(isFull()) {
            wait();
        }
        buffer[putIndex] = value;
        putIndex = (putIndex + 1) % buffer.length;
        notifyAll();
    }

    public synchronized int get() throws InterruptedException {
        while(isEmpty()) {
            wait();
        }
        int value = buffer[takeIndex];
        buffer[takeIndex] = null;
        takeIndex = (takeIndex + 1) % buffer.length;
        notifyAll();
        return value;
    }

}
```

We extend the single-slot buffer to a **bounded buffer** (size 3). The producer and consumer now work with this larger buffer.

**Does it work?** Yes! The producer and consumer correctly block when the buffer is full or empty, respectively.

However, you might notice that the output can be a bit jumbled. This is because both threads are printing to the console, and their outputs can interleave.

**Sample output:**
```
Main thread started
Produced: 1
Consumed: 1
Consumed: 2
Produced: 2
Produced: 3
Consumed: 3
Consumed: 4
Produced: 4
Consumed: 5
Produced: 5
Consumed: 6
Produced: 6
Consumed: 7
Produced: 7
Produced: 8
Consumed: 8
Produced: 9
Produced: 10
Consumed: 9
Consumed: 10
Main thread finished
```

#### Why does `Consumed: 2` appear before `Produced: 2`?

That's perfectly fine. The producer does:
1. `buffer.put(i)`
2. `System.out.println("Produced: " + i)`

The **put** happens inside a synchronized method and completes before the consumer can `get()` that value. But once `put(i)` returns, the **producer's print** is *not atomic* with the put. The scheduler may switch to the consumer **after the put but before the print**, so the consumer prints `Consumed: 2` first, then the producer prints `Produced: 2`. Timeline:
- Producer: `put(2)` âœ…
- Scheduler switches
- Consumer: `get()` â†’ prints `Consumed: 2`
- Scheduler switches
- Producer: prints `Produced: 2`

So the logs can interleave, but the **data flow is still correct**: items are produced before they're consumed. Your buffer's synchronization guarantees that.

#### Is the sequence correct overall?

Everything consumed is **1..10 exactly once** (no loss/dup). The order is FIFO even though the *print lines* interleave with producer prints. That matches the intended behavior.

#### Is the buffer correct?

Yes:

- Proper **`while` + `wait()/notifyAll()`** pattern.
- Circular indices give **FIFO**.
- `isFull()` / `isEmpty()` are called **only** from synchronized `put/get`, so they're safe.

**Is there a way to make sure the print/log works correctly too?**

Keep the lock while you log, so the consumer can't slip in between the `put()` and the "Produced:" print (and vice-versa).

```java
package io.github.smdaziz.thread.synchronization;

import java.util.Random;

public class BoundedBufferThread {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Main thread started");

        Thread producerThread = new Thread(new BoundedBufferProducer(buffer));

        producerThread.start();
        consumerThread.start();
        try {
            producerThread.join();
            consumerThread.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println("Main thread finished");
    }

}

        Random random = new Random();
        for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            try {
                buffer.put(i);
                Thread.sleep(random.nextInt(10) * 250);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }

}

class BoundedBufferConsumer implements Runnable {

    private BoundedBuffer buffer;

    public BoundedBufferConsumer(BoundedBuffer buffer) {
        this.buffer = buffer;
    }

    public void run() {
        Random random = new Random();
        for(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            try {
                int value = buffer.get();
                Thread.sleep(random.nextInt(10) * 200);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }

}

class BoundedBuffer {

    private Integer[] buffer;
    private int putIndex = 0;
    private int takeIndex = 0;

    public BoundedBuffer(int size) {
        buffer = new Integer[size];
    }

    private boolean isFull() {
        for(Integer i : buffer) {
            if(i == null) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    private boolean isEmpty() {
        for(Integer i : buffer) {
            if(i != null) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    public synchronized void put(int value) throws InterruptedException {
        while(isFull()) {
            wait();
        }
        buffer[putIndex] = value;
        putIndex = (putIndex + 1) % buffer.length;
        System.out.println("Produced: " + value);
        notifyAll();
    }

    public synchronized int get() throws InterruptedException {
        while(isEmpty()) {
            wait();
        }
        int value = buffer[takeIndex];
        buffer[takeIndex] = null;
        takeIndex = (takeIndex + 1) % buffer.length;
        notifyAll();
        System.out.println("Consumed: " + value);
        return value;
    }

}
```

We move the print statements **inside** the synchronized `put()` and `get()` methods, right after the buffer update.

**What it shows:**
- Now the output is always in the expected order: `Produced: X` always appears before `Consumed: X`.
- The producer and consumer still block correctly when the buffer is full/empty.
- The buffer remains thread-safe and FIFO.
- The print statements are now part of the critical section, so no interleaving occurs between `put()` and its print, or `get()` and its print.
- The overall behavior and correctness of the bounded buffer remain intact.

**Takeaways:**
- Keeping related actions (like updating state and logging) inside the same synchronized block ensures consistent output without sacrificing thread safety.
- However, be cautious: if the print statements are slow or blocking, they can reduce concurrency. In real applications, consider using a thread-safe logging framework that buffers output to avoid slowing down critical sections.
- This approach is fine for simple demos but may not scale well in high-throughput systems.
- Always balance correctness, performance, and clarity based on your application's needs.
- For production code, consider using higher-level concurrency utilities like `BlockingQueue` from `java.util.concurrent`, which handle much of this complexity for you.
- They provide built-in blocking behavior and are generally more efficient and easier to use than manual synchronization with `wait()` and `notify()`.
- They also help avoid common pitfalls like missed signals and spurious wakeups.
- Using `BlockingQueue` can significantly simplify producer-consumer implementations while ensuring thread safety and performance.
